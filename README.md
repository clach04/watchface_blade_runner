Watchface Blade Runner
======================

Influenced by JanSolo's Blade Runner Big Font, https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/54c2c12af3cb6c7fb1000071?dev_settings=true&native=false which is a Big Time https://github.com/pebble-examples/big-time implemention with a Blade Runner inspired font.

This uses a font (rather than bitmap) for display and has a number of other features, including:
  * icon
  * (configurable) color support
  * Battery level
  * Date
  * Bluetooth disconnect support

However the time display is significantly smaller due to limitations with the Pebble SDK/firmware (see https://forums.pebble.com/t/what-is-maximum-font-size-that-i-can-display-on-pebble/2822/10 for details).

This was built using:
  * Kemosabe's Fonts - Blade Runner. Downloaded from http://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Blade_Runner.htm
  * icon extacted from Blade Runner Movie Font by Phil Steinschneider, from https://www.dafont.com/blade-runner-movie-font.font
